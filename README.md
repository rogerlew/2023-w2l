Here are some links to rurality that could be useful. 1. https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/geography/guidance/geo-areas/urban-rural.html 
2. Defining Rural at the US Census Bureau. 2016. https://www2.census.gov/geo/pdfs/reference/ua/Defining_Rural.pdf 
3. https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/rural-urban-commuting-area-codes.aspx
4. Defining the â€œRural in Rural America. 2008  https://www.ers.usda.gov/amber-waves/2008/june/defining-the-rural-in-rural-america

also this has past fires  and historical (but not future) climate. Similar to Climate Toolbox but has customizable elements https://www.climateengine.org/
this is also a potentially useful resource: https://fema.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=90c0c996a5e242a79345cdbc5f758fc6
